# React + TypeScript + Vite

This README.md provides a setup to get React working in Vite.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Y2K Music Player

This is a personal project using Y2K bubble-gum colors and silver trim aesthetics to bring a colorful music player to the user. It's a test on using React + Vite + TypeScript with linked-list features for the TOP as trial and error exercise as I learn the fundamentals of advanced JS. 

##  Features

- Y2K Aesthetic: Nostalgic early 2000s design with pink and silver gradients, holographic effects, and metallic textures
- Linked List Playlist: Custom implementation for efficient song navigation and playlist management
- Interactive Music Player: Play, pause, skip, and volume controls with progress tracking
- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- TypeScript: Fully typed for better development experience and code safety
